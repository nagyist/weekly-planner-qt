=================

The Qt Weekly Planner Example Application demonstrates view navigation with a Windows Phone-like Pivotal navigation component

 It contains a smooth QML UI with view navigation and subtle transition animations. The QtQuick? UI components are being utilised for e.g. the navigation (PageStack?, ToolBar?), and showing Dialogs etc. The application also demonstrates how to integrate a native Qt C++ model to the QML application. Weekly Planner uses the Qt C++ model to store the events on the disk during application closing, and restores them on application startup.

This application features pivotal navigation, using a custom-made Pivot UI component.

You can find the Qt Quick Components project page from the Qt Quick Components​wiki page. The whole Qt Quick Components list (for Symbian), including all of the components used in the Weekly Planner example app, can be found on the​All Qt Quick Components page.
The application has been developed in parallel with a​corresponding Windows Phone version.
